			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of mental health has only been increasing. Alongside the virus, the stresses and anxiety that we are feeling have also been widespread. The pandemic has been disruptive, not only to our jobs and education, but also our way of life. 
      </br>
      </br>
      From hanging out with friends and family, to playing our favourite sports and going on vacations, the pandemic has placed multiple - and strict - restrictions on our freedom to do as we desire. Many people have lost their jobs. There is uncertainty about how the economy will progress, and when it will recover. 
      </br>
      </br>
      It seems like we may be losing control of where we currently are in our lives. Without a sense of security and a set direction as to how the world is evolving, it is okay to feel anxious, confused, sad or even bored<sup>1</sup>. These thoughts and feelings can be overwhelming, and we must take the time to look inward and check in with ourselves. We must find support in each other, and reach out to our friends, family, colleagues and even strangers.
  </p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Through thorough research, it was observed that there were <strong> two main groups </strong> that struggled the most with mental health on a day-to-day basis. While the COVID-19 situation may pose impacts on the other age groups as well, it is safe to assume that the effects are felt <em> on top </em>  of the circumstances that these two age groups were already facing. 
      </br>
      </br>
      Alongside <strong> secondary research </strong> on the background of these demographic groups, <strong> interviews </strong> were also conducted to derive the reasons for psychological pressure during the pandemic, from five individuals from each age group. Questions were also posed to interviewees on the topics they wish to see on the website that <strong> aims to provide them with the support they may need</strong>.

      <ul>Research has shown that there are two main groups that struggle most with their mental health: 
        </br>
        </br>
        <ol> <strong> 1. The sandwich generation<sup>2</sup><sup> 4</sup>: </strong> 
        <ul>
          <ol> <em>1. “The working-age population includes the so-called ‘sandwich generation’—men and women in their 40s, 50s and 60s who may be helping support teenage children or children in their 20s and 30s who are still living at home, as well as providing care for younger children, ageing parents, and in some cases partners and young children from second and third families as well.”</em> </ol>
          </br>
          <ol><em> 2. “More than half of the Australian population—53% or 12.5 million people—are aged between 25 and 64.” </em></ol>

          </ul>
          </ol>
        </br>
        </br>
        <ol><strong> 2. The most vulnerable<sup>3</sup>: </strong>
            <ul> 
              <ol><em>1. “Overall, 15–24 year olds had the highest proportion of mental or behavioural conditions (26%) and 0–14 year olds had the lowest (11%).”</em></ol>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Through primary and secondary research, characteristics, goals, motivations and frustrations of individuals in the "Young Persons" age group (15 to 24 year olds) and the "Sandwich Generation" (45 to 54 year olds) could be identified. From there, I could create three user profiles that introduce the mental struggles of these parties.
		 </p>
		 
		 <hr class="block1">
		 <h4 id="user-profile-1" style =  "color: #32a89b" ><strong>Trevor the Troubled</strong></h4>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Age: 17</li>
			 <li>Job: Student, Part-time Waiter</li>
			 <li>Family: Older of 2 Siblings, Lives with Parents</li>
			 <li>Location: Sydney, Australia</li>
			 <li>Struggle: Early Onsight of Generalised Anxiety Disorder<sup>5</sup>, Perfectionism</li>
		 </ul>


		 <h5><em>Background</em></h5>
		 <p>Trevor is a 17 year old that is in the midst of his final examinations before he moves on to University. On top of his schoolwork, Trevor was working a part-time job as a waiter to earn some pocket money for himself to spend. He likes to exercise and go outdoors - he loves to go on hikes and runs during his free time. He also likes to spend time with friends and family, travelling within and out of the city often. </p>

		 <h5><em>Struggles</em></h5>
		 <p>However, Trevor struggles with early onsight of generalised anxiety disorder. He worries about situations that are not within his control or unlikely to happen, with little to no reason to be. He often feels tense. He is also a perfectionist. This means that he expects the best of himself, putting pressure on himself to strive, constantly pushing himself out of his comfort zone. This explains why he is high-functioning, as he believes that being out-and-about and on-the-go with his life is the way to manage his anxiety. 
		 </br>
		 </br>
		 When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Trevor was forced to learn online, and his job was put on hold. This limited the amount of time he could be out, also varsely decreasing the amount of time he interacted with others. He did not know how to deal with this new plight.
		 </p>

		 <h5><em>Motivations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Better understand his conditions and how to manage them independently</li>
			 <li>Seek professional help</li>
			 <li>Find a good support network where he can speak openly</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Frustrations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Finding simple and concise information that he can relate to</li>
			 <li>Takes time to open up to his problems</li>
			 <li>Lack of vocabulary to articulate his emotions and thoughts</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Preferred Channels</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Social media - Facebook, Reddit and Snapchat</li>
			 <li>Gaming platform - Discord</li>
			 <li>Mobile - Text and iMessage</li>
		 </ul>
		</br>
		<hr class="dashed1">

		<h4 id="user-profile-2" style =  "color: #32a89b"><strong>Patricia the Parent-Child</strong></h4>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Age: 50</li>
			 <li>Job: Banker</li>
			 <li>Family: Only child of 2 parents in their late 80s, Wife, Mother of 2 children (Trevor and Tyler), Lives with husband and children</li>
			 <li>Location: Sydney, Australia</li>
			 <li>Struggle: Query Bipolar Disorder<sup>6&nbsp7</sup>, Menopause</li>
		 </ul>


		 <h5><em>Background</em></h5>
		 <p>Patricia is a 50-year-old mother of 2 children - one who is 17 and one who is 15. She currently resides with her working husband in a suburb in Sydney, Australia, working as a banker. She is also supporting her parents who live further inland, who both work part-time jobs that are still insufficient to support their everyday needs. Therefore, she is considered to be part of the “sandwich generation”, which are a group of individuals who have to earn for their ageing parents and their growing children.</p>

		 <h5><em>Struggles</em></h5>
		 <p>Biologically, Patricia is going through menopause. This results in mood swings that affect her feelings, thoughts and behaviour. Additionally, she is suspected to have a bipolar disorder, which causes her to bounce between extreme periods of high energy or self-destructivism. However, while she is aware of her actions, she does not seem to understand why they are so. 
		 </br>
		 </br>
		 When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Patricia’s job as a banker was threatened. As the economy dipped, she saw more of her colleagues being retrenched, making her feel more anxious about her own position. She starts to observe that the combination of all these struggles have put pressure and inflicted pain onto her husband and children. 
		 </p>

		 <h5><em>Motivations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Better understand and cope with her mental and biological conditions</li>
			 <li>Find tips on how to be mindful and calm in situations that are not in her control</li>
			 <li>Find individual and group activities to disengage herself from her stress</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Frustrations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Lack of time to look through long content</li>
			 <li>Strong belief that there are other worries besides her mental health</li>
			 <li>Struggles with confidence and motivation</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Preferred Channels</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Social media - Facebook and Whatsapp</li>
			 <li>Mobile - Text, Email and iMessage</li>
			 <li>Mail</li>

			 <li>Age: 52</li>
			 <li>Job: Engineer</li>
			 <li>Family: Husband of Patricia and Father of 2 children (Trevor and Tyler)</li>
			 <li>Location: Sydney, Australia</li>
			 <li>Struggle: No queries, Mild periods of insecurity</li>
		 </ul>


		 <h5><em>Background</em></h5>
		 <p>William is a 52-year-old father to Trevor (and Tyler) and husband of Patricia. Both his parents have passed on when he was younger, so he does not lie within the definition of the “sandwich generation”. He works as an engineer, which requires him to be physically active and on-the-ground on the weekdays. This means that he spends little time at home with his wife and children in the daytime from Monday to Friday.</p>

		 <h5><em>Struggles</em></h5>
		 <p>As a third-party, William has observed the changes that have occurred in both his son and wife. Tensions have been rising at home. The two have been struggling to understand each other’s struggles and communicate openly. William feels that it is his responsibility to ensure peace at home. He wants his family to be happy. 
		 </p>

		 <h5><em>Motivations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Better understand the struggles of both his son and wife</li>
			 <li>Offer support to both parties by bridging gaps of knowledge and facilitating conversations</li>
			 <li>Peace in the family</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Frustrations</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Difficulty in encouraging the two parties</li>
			 <li>Difficulty in being transparent and open because of the lack of vocabulary</li>
			 <li>Finds himself insecure of his efforts and having the tendency to self-blame</li>
		 </ul>

		 <h5><em>Preferred Channels</em></h5>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Mobile - WhatsApp, Text, Email and iMessage</li>
			 <li>Mail</li>
			 <li>News Channels</li>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>After the initial research and evaluation of the current site of Mental Health Foundation Australia, I wanted to create a site that focuses on <strong>information as empowerment</strong>. Through research, I was also able to ideate a theme - <strong>balance</strong>. This theme can be both applicable to my two target age groups, the Young People (15 to 24 years old) and the Middle-Aged (45 to 54 years old).</p>
			
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Optio qui, omnis itaque rerum iusto molestiae necessitatibus deleniti quod tenetur id perspiciatis voluptatum dolorum
				quisquam eius ipsum non architecto labore! Distinctio, tenetur. Officiis, necessitatibus?</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p><strong>Low Fidelity Sketches</strong> were important to guide my design processes and way of thought. 
			</br>
			</p>	
			<h4>Brainstorming Content and Creating a Site Map</h4>
			<h5><em>Theme of the site: Balance</em></h5>
			<p>
			Firstly, it was identified that the users of both age groups struggle with establishing balance. For a start, a good state of mind is that of Zen<sup>8</sup>. Zen refers to a state of mind where one feels peaceful and relaxed. It is a meditative state. In order for us to reach this state, one has to be <strong>balanced and conscious in the mind.</strong> 
			</br></br>
			As a Young Person, this will mean <strong>balancing expectations</strong> from peers and themselves, and being mindful and appreciative of their <strong>purpose.</strong>
		</br></br>
			As a Middle-Aged Person, this takes on a more <strong>pragmatic</strong> stance. It begs the questions: "How can I achieve <strong>work-life balance</strong>? How am I able to take care of not just my family, but also <strong>myself</strong>?"

			<img src="riley's/Photo1.jpeg" alt="Sketch and Notes for the website's theme and Creating the Site Map" width="90%" height="90%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 50px">
			</p>

			<h5><em>Direction of Site: Informative yet Interactive</em></h5>
			<p>Through user interviews, it was understood that <strong>information on mental health must be present on the website.</strong> This builds on to the importance of information as empowerment, encouraging individuals to learn and take control of way of thought and feelings. This paves a way to a better state of mind. 
			</br></br>
			However, it was also expressed that information presented <strong>should not presented in a long and boring manner.</strong> Therefore, there was a need for <strong>interaction or responsive elements</strong> on the site.
	
		</br></br>
			</p>

			<h5><em>Design of Site: Simple yet Effective</em></h5>
			<p>Going through a couple of mental health websites, I narrowed down to four different website layouts for users to vote for. I also generated four different colour palettes for them so choose from. 
			</br></br>
			Through assessing their votes and their comments, it was evidently clear that users preferred a <strong>a good balance of illustrations and words</strong> on all pages. Real-life pictures (of human beings) were not well-liked. 
		</br></br>
			The bulk of content should be <strong>hidden from sight</strong>. Instead a <strong>summary and/or labels</strong> for content should be used to <strong>hint users on what they can expect</strong> from the pages after they have made a selection on the site.
	</br></br>
	<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>		
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Symmetrical</strong> about the middle line of page to highlight the idea of balance</li>
	<li><strong>Information</strong> on landing page and sub landing pages should be kept minimal</li>
	<li><strong>Interactive</strong> and responsive elements (such as hover) can be used to make site more visually interesting</li>
	<li><strong>Illustrations</strong> and Animations can be used to create appeal</li>
	<li><strong>Layout and elements</strong> should be organised to allow users to make mistakes and return</li>
</ul>

Based on the Site Map above, sketches were made to showcase the individual pages. The ones that will be used for the site is indicated with a red tick &#x2714; .

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>After identifying the features that are important for the site (as explained in the "Conclusion" segment above), wireframes could be generated to arrange the elements <strong>in proportion</strong> to the desktop and phone screen sizes. 
			</br></br>
			In the below wireframes and mockups, a Macbook Pro screen size and iPhone X screen size were used as references.
		</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Wireframing is the core of showing <strong>information architecture.</strong> Based on the assessment that was completed in the Low Fidelity Sketches, wireframes could be generated directly to display the placement of elements and encourage future feedback.

	In the below figure, wireframes were first generated for the desktop. The corresponding iPhone screens were then modelled directly below.
