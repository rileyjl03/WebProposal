			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of mental health has only been increasing. Alongside the virus, the stresses and anxiety that we are feeling have also been widespread. The pandemic has been disruptive, not only to our jobs and education, but also our way of life. 
      </br>
      </br>
      From hanging out with friends and family, to playing our favourite sports and going on vacations, the pandemic has placed multiple - and strict - restrictions on our freedom to do as we desire. Many people have lost their jobs. There is uncertainty about how the economy will progress, and when it will recover. 
      </br>
      </br>
      It seems like we may be losing control of where we currently are in our lives. Without a sense of security and a set direction as to how the world is evolving, it is okay to feel anxious, confused, sad or even bored<sup>1</sup>. These thoughts and feelings can be overwhelming, and we must take the time to look inward and check in with ourselves. We must find support in each other, and reach out to our friends, family, colleagues and even strangers.
  </p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>Through thorough research, it was observed that there were <strong> two main groups </strong> that struggled the most with mental health on a day-to-day basis. While the COVID-19 situation may pose impacts on the other age groups as well, it is safe to assume that the effects are felt <em> on top </em>  of the circumstances that these two age groups were already facing. 
      </br>
      </br>
      Alongside <strong> secondary research </strong> on the background of these demographic groups, <strong> interviews </strong> were also conducted to derive the reasons for psychological pressure during the pandemic, from five individuals from each age group. Questions were also posed to interviewees on the topics they wish to see on the website that <strong> aims to provide them with the support they may need</strong>.

      <ul>Research has shown that there are two main groups that struggle most with their mental health: 
        </br>
        </br>
        <ol> <strong> 1. The sandwich generation<sup>2</sup><sup> 4</sup>: </strong> 
        <ul>
          <ol> <em>1. “The working-age population includes the so-called ‘sandwich generation’—men and women in their 40s, 50s and 60s who may be helping support teenage children or children in their 20s and 30s who are still living at home, as well as providing care for younger children, ageing parents, and in some cases partners and young children from second and third families as well.”</em> </ol>
          </br>
          <ol><em> 2. “More than half of the Australian population—53% or 12.5 million people—are aged between 25 and 64.” </em></ol>

          </ul>
          </ol>
        </br>
        </br>
        <ol><strong> 2. The most vulnerable<sup>3</sup>: </strong>
            <ul> 
              <ol><em>1. “Overall, 15–24 year olds had the highest proportion of mental or behavioural conditions (26%) and 0–14 year olds had the lowest (11%).”</em></ol>
            </ul>

          </ol>
        </ul>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Through primary and secondary research, characteristics, goals, motivations and frustrations of individuals in the "Young Persons" age group (15 to 24 year olds) and the "Sandwich Generation" (45 to 54 year olds) could be identified. From there, I could create three user profiles that introduce the mental struggles of these parties.
